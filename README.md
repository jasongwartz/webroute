## Overview

Webroute provides a few packages which make building and consuming HTTP APIs a breeze, both on the client- and server-side.

As opposed to monolithic frameworks, webroute merely provides you with the tools to create powerful APIs alongside your favourite runtime, full-stack framework and/or platform.

## Why?

Modern API development is extremely fragmented across vast combinations of frameworks, runtimes and platforms. Monolithic web frameworks are no longer suitable.

Instead, webroute has implemented the core elements you _might_ need in a web framework, and you can easily piece together those that suit your use case.

## Compatibility

Webroute works with all runtimes or frameworks that conform to the WinterCG Minimum Web Standard.
