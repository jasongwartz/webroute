## Routing

Since `webroute` is just a small utility, it is not opinionated about if or how you manage routing â€“ by design.

Typically, web frameworks bundle together core functionality with routing, tightly coupling the two. However this causes routing unnecessarily coupled. As we will see, routing need not be tightly coupled with `webroute`.

<Callout>

The issues with tightly-coupled routing become more obvious when using filesystem routing, for example.

### No Routing

It's completely valid to export a single route and call it a day.

```ts
Bun.serve({
  fetch: myRoute(req)
});
```

### Simple Routing

Alternatively, `webroute`s have a very basic matching utility which can be used to implement a router in one LOC.

```ts
Bun.serve({
	fetch: (req) => {
		const match = routes.find(route => route.match(req))

		return match?.(req)
	}
})
```

<Callout>

In smaller projects this approach is sufficient. However, as the number of routes or path complexity increases, you may want to consider using a more sophisticated router for better performance.

### Third Party routers

#### Individually

Routes can be added to external routers one-by-one by simply assigning the route information to the external router.

```ts
app.get(myRoute.getPath(), myRoute)
```



#### Many at Once

We can easily map every route to an external router by just iterating over every route and assigning the method-path combinations to their respective route handlers.

```ts title="hono-example.ts"
const app = new Hono()

routes.forEach(route => {
	// For every route, map each method to the route handler
	for(const method of route.getMethods()) {
		app[method](route.getPath(), c => route(c.req))
	}
})

export default app
```

Bear in mind most external routers care about route registration order.
