TODO: Write about `route`


## Routing

`webroute` is library. It is not opinionated about if or how you manage routing.

It is completed valid to export a single route and call it a day.

```ts
Bun.serve({
  fetch: myRoute(req)
});
```

However, to make multiple routes easier to work with, a utility for managing multiple routes is provided. This can be used to wire up external routers, for example.

<Callout>

Typically, web frameworks bundle together core functionality with routing itself. However this causes the routing and other concerns to be conflated and unnecessarily coupled. With filesystem routing in particular, this becomes especially awkward.

```ts title="hono-example.ts"
import { Atlas } from "@webroute/atlas"

// Atlas is an array instance of all API operations,
// with some extra helpers
const myRoutes = new Atlas({
	GetPostRoute,
	UpdatePostRoute,
	/*...*/
})

const app = new Hono()

myRoutes.forEach(({ method, path, handler }) => {
	app[method](c => handler(c.req))
	// i.e. app.get("/posts")
})
```
