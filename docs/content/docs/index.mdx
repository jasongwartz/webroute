Webroute is a toolkit for building and interacting with APIs in a type-safe, robust and ergonomic manner.

It was designed to work with your existing stack, or be used standalone. As a result, webroute offers a selection of independent packages which you can mix-and-match as needed.

Additionally, industry standards are heavily leaned into so you can "learn the platform" instead of another bespoke framework API.

## Get Started

The fastest way to get started with webroute is via the `create-webroute-app` CLI.

```sh
npx create-webroute-app webroute-app
```

This will dynamically build an starter app with the features you require.

## Philosophy

To achieve a balance of flexibility, ease of use and interoperability, webroute adheres to a few principles.

| Concept          | Description                                                                            |
| ---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Web Standard** | Use web standard interfaces over bespoke abstractions                                  |
| **Immutable**    | Avoiding mutating data, or if you must, doing so explicitly                            |
| **Pure**         | Preferring basic input/output functions over side-effectful ones                       |
| **Atomic**       | Standalone functionality is better than requiring complex integration or orchestration |
| **Declarative**  | When useful, prefer declarative over imperative approaches, enabling introspection     |
| **No magic**     | No monkey-patching, no wrapped `Request`/`Response` objects, no magical compilers      |
| **Composable**   | Prefer composition over orchestration so pipelines are traceable and reasonable        |

These principles, and their benefits will become clearer over the course of these docs.
