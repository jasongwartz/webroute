`webroute` is a framework-agnostic toolkit for building web-standard APIs.

## What does this mean?

Instead of requiring massive framework buy-in, `webroute` consists of various independent packages that do not rely on each other. This means they can be used separately, with other frameworks and libraries or in conjunction.

The APIs and package boundaries have been painstakingly obsessed over. In that regard, `webroute` is, first and foremost, a philosophy and approach, and a set of packaged code a close second.

## Philosophy

Below are some of the principles we value, when building or designing new tooling.

| Concept          | Description                                                                            |
| ---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Web Standard** | Use web standard interfaces over bespoke abstractions                                  |
| **Immutable**    | Avoiding mutating data, or if you must, doing so explicitly                            |
| **Pure**         | Preferring basic input/output functions over side-effectful ones                       |
| **Atomic**       | Standalone functionality is better than requiring complex integration or orchestration |
| **Declarative**  | When useful, prefer declarative over imperative approaches, enabling introspection     |
| **No magic**     | No monkey-patching, wrapped `Request`/`Response` objects                               |
| **Composable**   | Prefer composition over orchestration so pipelines are traceable and reasonable        |
