**Webroute is a suite of independent tools for building server-side apps and APIs, based on the [WinterCG Minimum Common Web API](https://common-min-api.proposal.wintercg.org/).**

Instead of a monolithic framework, Webroute provides a handful of independent packages. Boundaries between **routing**, **middleware**, **validation**, **routing** and **client** are clearly defined and separate. This means you're not tied down by framework or runtime.

## Philosophy

When building new web tools, the following principles are followed.

| Concept          | Description                                                                            |
| ---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Web Standard** | Use web standard interfaces over bespoke abstractions                                  |
| **Immutable**    | Avoiding mutating data, or if you must, doing so explicitly                            |
| **Pure**         | Preferring basic input/output functions over side-effectful ones                       |
| **Atomic**       | Standalone functionality is better than requiring complex integration or orchestration |
| **Declarative**  | When useful, prefer declarative over imperative approaches, enabling introspection     |
| **No magic**     | No monkey-patching, wrapped `Request`/`Response` objects                               |
| **Composable**   | Prefer composition over orchestration so pipelines are traceable and reasonable        |
