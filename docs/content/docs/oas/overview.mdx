```ts
import { OAS, createSpec } from "@webroute/oas"
```

`@webroute/oas` enables using schema and validation libraries to build OpenAPI Specs. It provides "decorators" which enrich schema with OpenAPI metadata and a spec builder which emits OpenAPI specs which honour these decorations.

## Decorators

<Callout>
These are *not* TypeScript/JavaScript decorators of the form `@Decorator`. However, similarly, they add semi-hidden metadata to our objects.
</Callout>

We can add metadata to our schema using the following decorators. We will use `zod` as an example.

```ts
const User = z.object({
	id: z.string(),
	name: z.string()
})

// Provide a config object
const UserWithMeta = OAS.Schema(
	User,
	{ id: "User", description: "A basic user" }
) // -> #/components/schemas/User

// Config object will be merged with derived config
const UserAsResponse = OAS.Response(UserWithMeta, {
	"201": {
		description: "201 Success",
		content: {
			"application/json": {
				/**...*/
			}
		}
	}
}) // -> 200 and 201 defined in spec

// Or, can use a function for custom merging behaviour
const UserAsBody = OAS.Body(UserWithMeta, (operation, schema) => ({
	...operation,
	content: { // Merge old and new `content`
		...operation.content,
		"application/xml": {
			schema // Add the JSON-schema
		}
	}
}))
```

## Creating specs

We can create specs using a simpler syntax and which leverages any `OAS` decoration we may have applied via the `createSpec` functionality.

The `spec` is based on the highly extensible `openapi3-ts` `OpenApiBuilder`.

```ts
import { createSpec } from "@webroute/oas"

const operations = [
	{
		path: "/foo",
		methods: ["get"],
		Query: QuerySchema,
		Params: ParamSchemaWithDecorators
	},
	{
		path: "/bar",
		methods: ["post", "put"],
		Body: BodySchema
	},
]

const spec = createSpec({ operations, formatter })

// --- Optionally customize spec here ---

return spec.getSpec()
```

### Formatter

```ts
declare const formatter: (input: unknown) => oas31.SchemaObject
```

Our spec builder requires a `formatter` which is responsible for transforming our validation schema into JSON Schema, compatible with the OpenAPI spec. You are welcome to use custom formatters, or third-party solutions, like `zod-to-json-schema`.

Alternatively, the `@webroute/schema` package supports this exact functionality across most popular schema libraries.
