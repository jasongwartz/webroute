`webroute` was inspired by using many different web frameworks over the years.

**Express**

`webroute` tries to retain the simplicity of express.

**tPRC**

tRPC popularised a very powerful implementation of the chained/fluent/builder pattern combined with type-safety. `webroute` has many similarities here.

**Hono**

Hono has provided a good foundation for thinking about web-standards-based APIs, not to mention the `@hono/node-server` which is recommended in these very docs.
