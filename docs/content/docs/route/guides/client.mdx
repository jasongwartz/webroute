title: Client-side Types
---

We can use our `routes` with `@webroute/client` by using the `ToClient` helper.

This will enable us to easily transform a record of routes into a type-safe client.


```ts
import { ToClient } from "@webroute/route"

// Export to monorepo or npm, perhaps...
export type AppDef = ToClient.InferApp<typeof appRoutes>;
```

We can then import this `AppDef` on the client side and use it with `@webroute/client`.

```ts
const client = createTypedClient<App>()({
	/**...*/
})
```
