Middleware was invented to avoid repeating the same functionality. However, typically an app or router will handle middleware, upstream from request handlers. This means it's not always clear what information the route will have access to, and tightly couples our code to the framework.

For example, traditionally middleware will use something like `app.use(...)` and in our route handler we might access a user like `req.user`. However it's never clear if `req.user` exists or if other middleware ends the request before the handler is even reached.

---

`webroute` takes a different approach. Routes build an explicit, type-safe, traceable chain of middleware by relying on standard code instead of app-level orchestration.

```ts twoslash
// ---cut-start---
import { route } from "@webroute/route";
import { z } from "zod";
declare function assert(x: any): void;
declare const isAuthed: boolean;

// ---cut-end---
route()
  .use((req, { state }) => {
    if (isAuthed) {
      // Return state updates
      return { isAuthed: true };
    }

    // Or, Return a response, completing the request early
    return Response.json({ code: "UNAUTHORIZED" }, { status: 401 });
  })
  .handle((req, { state }) => {
    assert(state.isAuthed === true);
    //           ^?
  });
```

## Middleware Rules

Notably, `webroute` middleware lacks any `next()` function which is an otherwise common approach to coordinating middleware. Instead, return values are relied on to determine what side-effects the middleware might have. One of three things can be returned:

```ts
Data | Response | ((response, ctx) => Response);
```

| Result               |                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data**             | A piece of data, in the form of an object, which will _overwrite_ the existing state    |
| **Response**         | A `Response`, indicating to early-return from the current request, given that response. |
| **Response handler** | A _response handler_ which will be called _after_ the handler has executed.             |
|                      | _Returning a primitive or empty value will have no effect - it will be ignored._        |

<Callout>
  Response handlers are executed in _reverse_ order. This is common behaviour
  you're likely accustomed to.
</Callout>

### Data and State

A common use-case of middleware is adding some information to our request. In other words, we are storing some _state_ about the current request.

Because `webroute` prohibits modifying a `Request` object, this is impossible. Instead we can just return state updates as an object. This will be accessible with full-type safety in successive middleware and handlers.

```ts twoslash
// ---cut-start---
import { route } from "@webroute/route";
// ---cut-end---
route()
	.use((req, { state }) => {
		return { user: { name: "webroute" }}
	})
	.handle((req, {state}) => {
		state.user.name
		//         ^?
	})
```

### Response

Returning a response early is very common flow used for authentication or validation, for example. We can "exit early" by returning a `Response`. This will cause `webroute` to skip the remaining middleware and handlers. 

<Callout>
Any response middleware already initialised _will_ be run. The next section elaborates on this idea.
</Callout>

```ts twoslash
// ---cut-start---
import { route } from "@webroute/route";
declare function getUser(req: Request): { id: number } | undefined;
// ---cut-end---
route()
	.use((req, { state }) => {
		const user = getUser(req);
		if(user) return { user }

		return Response.json("Unauthorized", { status: 401 })
	})
	.use(() => {
		console.log("This will not run, unless I'm logged in")
	})
	.handle((req, { state }) => {
		console.log("Neither will this.")

		// State shape is still preserved
		state.user
		//    ^?
	})
```

### Response Handler

Our middleware can finally also return a _response handler_. As the name suggests, this can be used to handle the response _after_ it's been handled by our main handler. Instead of having access to the `Request`, our response handlers have access to the `Response` as the first parameter.


```ts twoslash
// ---cut-start---
import { route } from "@webroute/route";
// ---cut-end---
route()
	.use((req, { state }) => {
		const start = Date.now()

		return (response) => {
			const headers = new Headers(req.headers)
			headers.set("elapsed", (Date.now() - start).toString())

			return new Response(response.body, {
				headers
			})
		}
	})
	.handle((req, { state }) => {
		//...
	})
```

By using this nested function approach, we can use _closures_ to retain access to any incoming request information or internal state we might want to access on the `Response`s journey out.


## Doing Multiple at Once

Since we can only return a single value, our three behaviours are _mutually exclusive_. One cannot update state _and_ add a request handler by returning a value. 

While it's not a bad idea to separate the concerns of middleware like this, there is a way to _update state_ without strictly returning it.

```ts
.use((req, { state }) => {
	state.foo = "bar"
})
```

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Type Safety with Mutations">

When we directly mutate the state object, we lose benefits like immutability and type-safety: future consumers won't know what data is available on the state.

To retain type-safety, at least, we can simply provide a type argument of the mutations we're hoping to make to the state.

```ts twoslash
// ---cut-start---
import { route } from "@webroute/route";
// ---cut-end---
route()
	.use<{ foo: true }>((req, { state }) => {
		// @ts-expect-error
		state.foo = true
	})
	.use<{ bar: false }>((req, { state }) => {
		// @ts-expect-error
		state.bar = false
	})
	.handle((req, { state }) => {
		const { foo, bar } = state;
	})
```

<Callout>
While state can be updated regardless of return value, early-exiting via `Response` and registering a response handler requires creating multiple middleware functions.
</Callout>

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Chaining

As we've seen here, middleware is very easy to chain. When combined with composition patterns, this becomes incredibly powerful. Learn more about [Composition](./composition).

## Reasoning

You might be wondering why this strange approach to middleware. On top of being strange, it is also _restrictive_.

The middleware design here is very intentional. The return-value approach is used as an alternative to passing framework-specific functions to our middleware. Consequently, our middleware here could actually be used wherever we want: it merely returns data or a web-standard `Respone` objects or handlers.

To learn more about this philosophy, visit [Middleware](./middleware/overview) package docs, for which this approach is derived.
