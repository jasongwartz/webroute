`route`s are agnostic to what router is used upstream. Since routes are standlone, we have many options for handling routing.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Why routing-agnostic?">
Typically web frameworks spread work across routers, handlers and middleware in a way tightly coupled to the given framework. This results in less portable, less scalable and more complex code.

By encoding route path and method information directly into the route, we are decoupling from the router. As a result, we can much more easily switch between routers, frameworks and runtimes with minimal changes.

> As an example, `webroute`s could trivially be migrated from `Hono` to `nextjs` filesystem routing, or vice versa, since there is little to no framework-coupling.

## No Routing

<Callout type="warn">
In smaller projects this approach is sufficient. However, as the number of routes or path complexity increases, you'll likely want to use a more sophisticated routing approach.
</Callout>

In many cases, you don't actually need a fancy router at all. It's completely valid to export a single route and call it a day.

```ts
Bun.serve({
  fetch: myRoute(req)
});
```

<Callout title="Helpers">
The `route.getPath` and `route.getMethods` helpers, found on the `route` export, are helpful for building custom routing.
</Callout>

## Filesystem Routing

Webroute shines in filesystem router contexts, where middleware is either unavailable or especially awkward. Additionally, `route`s are very lightweight, only loading the necessary code for each route invocation.

`webroute` works idiomatically with filesystem routers.

```ts title="posts/route.ts"
// GET /posts
export const GET = route("/ignored-path") // <- This pathname will be ignored
	.method('put') // <- And so will this method
	.handle(() => {})
```

## `@webroute/router`

Another webroute package, `@webroute/router` was built specifically as a basic, no-frills web router. It is extremely lightweight and merely matches an incoming request to one of your routes (or any other function).

Learn more about the [Router](/docs/router/overview) package.

## Third Party Frameworks

In more sophisticated apps, or if integrating with an existing app, we may wish to use an external router/framework.

### One-by-one

In the most basic case, we can simply wire up our routes explicitly and manually.

```ts title="hono-example.ts"
const app = new Hono()

app.on(
	route.getMethods(myRoute), // METHODS
	route.getPath(myRoute),    // PATH
	myRoute                    // HANDLER
	)
```

### Many at Once

We can also perform this iteratively when we have quite a few routes.

```ts title="hono-example.ts" twoslash
// ---cut-start---
import { Hono } from "hono"
import { route } from "@webroute/core"
const routes = [
	route().handle(() => {})
]
// ---cut-end---
const app = new Hono()

// For every route, map each method to the route handler
for(const r of routes) {
	app.on(route.getMethods(r), route.getPath(r), c => r(c.req.raw))
}

// This is a completely valid, production ready "hono adapter"
export default app
```

<Callout>

Bear in mind most external routers care about route registration order.

</Callout>

### What about adapters?

As we've seen above, connecting our routes to existing apps is fairly straightforward: merely register the apps path and method(s) with the route itself. Instead of providing and maintaining adapters, we think it's more robust to leave that up to the developer.

Ultimately, by writing your own "adapter" code, you will retain greater control, with pretty minimal work.
