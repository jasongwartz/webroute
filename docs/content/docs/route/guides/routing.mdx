Since `webroute` is just a small utility, it's intentionally unopinionated about if or how you manage routing.

By intentionally separating these two pieces of functionality, our applications actually become simpler, and the same code becomes usable in many more contexts.

In practice, the routing part of the process is actually pretty basic and doesn't warrant coupling our code like traditional frameworks implore us to do.

---

## Why routing-agnostic?

Typically web frameworks spread work across routers, handlers and middleware in a way tightly coupled to the given framework. This results in less portable, less scalable and more complex code.

By encoding route path and method information directly into the route, we are decoupling the router. As a result, we can much more easily switch between routers, frameworks and runtimes with minimal changes.

> As an example, `webroute`s could trivially be migrated from `Hono` to `nextjs` filesystem routing, or vice versa, since there is little to no framework-coupling.

## Basic Routing

In many cases, you don't actually need a fancy router.

### No Routing

It's completely valid to export a single route and call it a day.

```ts
Bun.serve({
  fetch: myRoute(req)
});
```

### Simple Routing

Alternatively, `webroute`s have a very basic matching utility which can be used to implement a router in one LOC.

```ts
Bun.serve({
	fetch: (req) => {
		// The order in which routes are specified in the `routes` array
		// would matter here
		const match = routes.find(r => {
			const path = route.getPath(r)
			const methods = route.getMethods(r)

			// TODO: Determine if route matches request
			return r
		})

		return match?.(req)
	}
})
```

In smaller projects this approach is sufficient. However, as the number of routes or path complexity increases, you may want to consider using a more sophisticated router for better performance.

### Filesystem Routing

Sometimes you aren't even in control of routing. `webroute` works idiomatically with filesystem routing.

```ts title="posts/route.ts"
// GET /posts
export const GET = route("/not-posts") // <- FYI: This path will be ignored
	.method('put') // <- And so will this method
	.handle(() => {})
```

<Callout>
Existing web frameworks typically encourage exporting a single app instance from one filesystem route. However, this circumvents all the benefits of filesystem routing.
</Callout>

### Routing Libraries

In more sophisticated apps, or if integrating with an existing app, we may wish to use an external router/framework.

#### One-by-one

In the most basic case, we can simply wire up our routes explicitly and manually.

```ts title="hono-example.ts"
const app = new Hono()

app.on(
	route.getMethods(myRoute), // METHODS
	route.getPath(myRoute),    // PATH
	myRoute                    // HANDLER
	)
```

#### Many at Once

We can also perform this iteratively when we have quite a few routes.

```ts title="hono-example.ts" twoslash
// ---cut-start---
import { Hono } from "hono"
import { route } from "@webroute/core"
const routes = [
	route().handle(() => {})
]
// ---cut-end---
const app = new Hono()

// For every route, map each method to the route handler
for(const r of routes) {
	app.on(route.getMethods(r), route.getPath(r), c => r(c.req.raw))
}

// This is a completely valid, production ready "hono adapter"
export default app
```

<Callout>

Bear in mind most external routers care about route registration order.

### What about adapters?

Providing adapters is a common and tempting approach for connecting our apps to other tools. However, the adapters themselves are often very thin wrappers akin to the example above.

Instead, we encourage writing your own adapter. This empowers you to make any customisations you like while also keeping things explicit. It also means you're in full control of updating versions, without having to wait on an adapter being developed.

In short: these types of adapaters increase coupling and are simple enough to write on your own, so you should do that.

With that said, we have provided some starting points in [Building Apps](./building-apps).
